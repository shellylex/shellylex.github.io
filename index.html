			<p class= "introduction"> Music has always been a part of my life, whether it was from my parents, or by listening to the stuff playing through the TV.
			Around my 10th birthday, I discovered EDM, and quickly got interested in "harder" music genres such as DnB, Dubstep (Brostep), and Hardmusic subgenres. <br><br>
			And in 2019 my mom offered me the DJ controller I wanted and started practicing DJing because I wanted to make my own DJ mixes for me (quite egoistic lol). 
			In January/February of 2020 I started to make music with FL Studio, which I started using quite often (almost daily) and the lockdown in France pushed me even more down this way. <br>
			I started by making beats, then I made DnB where I learned a lot about sound design on youtube, and I ended up making Techno and Jungle, as well as Boom Bap sometimes. <br><br>
			
			I'm super influenced by 90's electronic music and how it really defines the roots of most of the things we hear nowadays in any music genres.
